[ISO Live-Demo](https://iso-frame.herokuapp.com/)
ISO is a full-stack single-page app inspired by photo sharing websites like 500px. It's built on Ruby on Rails for the back-end and React/Redux for the front-end to produce a 'RESTful' JSON API.

## Features
- User Authentication with automated demo-login
- User photo uploads
- User ability to follow/unfollow users for a dynamic feed page
- User ability to comment on photos
- Discover page to browse new photos and find new users to follow
- Responsive photo display on various screen sizes via CSS
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 Storage
- Uses PostgreSQL to handle database responsibilities

### User Authentication with automated demo-login
Users can use the demo-login provided to get right into the action.

### User ability to follow/unfollow users
Users can follow or unfollow users, which will dynamically change the photos that are appearing on the current user's feed.

### Mobile Responsiveness
ISO's photo gallery is responsive to varying screen sizes. Users can share similar experiences on ISO from the computer or on the mobile devices.

Here are some features that I plan on adding in the near future:
